# Mode-Choice-Predictor
A randomForest model predicting the mode of travel used for trips in Puget Sound. 

Project prep.R is the data cleaning script; its output becomes an input for mode choice prediction.R.

Dataset can be downloaded from the [Puget Sound Regional Council](https://www.psrc.org/our-work/household-travel-survey-program).
